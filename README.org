Dotfiles---A place for combining all my GNU/Linux configuration
files.

[[./resources/screenshot-2.png]]

* Setup

Setting up my dotfiles is pretty much straightforward, as I have
automated it almost completely:

#+begin_src shell
$ # Create a nix-shell with git and stow available.
$ nix-shell -p git stow

[nix-shell] $ git clone https://codeberg.org/guemax/dotfiles .dotfiles
[nix-shell] $ cd .dotfiles/
[nix-shell] $ # Make the setup script executable
[nix-shell] $ chmod +x setup.sh
[nix-shell] $ sudo ./setup.sh
#+end_src

That's it, have fun with your system!

* Additional setup

** Permanently enabling Redshift

For permanently enabling Redshift, create the following file:

#+begin_src shell
~/.config/systemd/user/default.target.wants/redshift.service
#+end_src

** Settings for HiDPI screens

Don't forget to enable scaling for HiDPI screens in Firefox (if you
need that), by going to ~about:config~ and searching for
~layout.css.devPixelsPerPx~.  I set the value to ~1.5~.

** Changing the background image

Use ~feh~ for setting your background image:

#+begin_src shell
feh --bg-scale /path/to/your/background-image
#+end_src
