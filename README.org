Dotfiles---A place for combining all my GNU/Linux configuration
files.

[[./resources/screenshot-3.png]]

* Setup

Clone this repo using git:

#+begin_src shell
  $ # Create a nix-shell with git and stow available.
  $ nix-shell -p git stow

  [nix-shell] $ git clone https://codeberg.org/guemax/dotfiles .dotfiles
  [nix-shell] $ cd .dotfiles/
#+end_src

You should now go ahead and look through the files
~nixos/home-manager.nix~ and ~nixos/general-configuration.nix~ to adjust
settings as needed (e.g. users, git config, etc.) and copy your LUKS
encryption settings (from ~/etc/nixos/configuration.nix~) to
~dell-inspiron-14-7000-configuration.nix~ (or delete them from the
latter).  Make sure to replace the absolute path for the XMonad
configuration in ~nixos/services.nix~ as well!

The rest of the setup is pretty much straightforward, as I have
automated it almost completely:

#+begin_src shell
  [nix-shell] $ chmod +x setup.sh
  [nix-shell] $ sudo ./setup.sh
#+end_src

That's it, have fun with your system!

* Additional setup

** Settings for HiDPI screens

Don't forget to enable scaling for HiDPI screens in Firefox (if you
need that), by going to ~about:config~ and searching for
~layout.css.devPixelsPerPx~.  I set the value to ~1.5~.
